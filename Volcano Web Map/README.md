This is an interactive map of all the volcanoes in America.


I learn how to combine Python core concepts with the codebase of a third-party Python web mapping 
library to create interactive web maps on the browser. 
That help me understand how to use core Python blocks such as conditionals, for-loops, and functions in a real-world program.
