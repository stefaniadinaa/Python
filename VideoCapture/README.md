The fundamental idea of the application is the continuous comparison of the previous frame to see if there is any difference.
If the frame is changed from the original one, it means that I have discovered a movement. 
The application is ideal especially for pet owners. 
You can see in real time what nonsense your cat is doing around the house or who is sleeping on your keyboard and then it is full of hair.

I use Python to process webcam video frame by frame and detect and highlight moving objects in those video frames.
